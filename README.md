# CS 100 Programming Project
> Winter 2020 - Alejandro Sherman (862062898) and Eddie...

##Introduction
Our project is the implementation of a basic command shell, complete with a user interface, and functionality of a certain commands and connectors. The shell will allow for the use of standard commands after they are input by a user, such as `exit`., as well as the use of three connectors that allow users to execute multiple commands at once. These connectors are "||" (or), "&&" (and), and ";" (semi). The composite design pattern will be utilized to implement the commands and the connectors. The project will be created in C++ and features will be implemented using C++ classes.
